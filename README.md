Nowt (nōt)
====

"Nowt," derived from "Note on the wall," is a web application that provides users a way to easily create postings to sell goods, plan events, offer services, and include numerous academically focused features.

Nowt was created from the desire to easily sell textbooks and offer educational services, but has evolved into a “student network” that goes beyond just being a classified advertisement platform.
